  I am a master student in Data Science at Boston University. I obtained dual Bachelor's degrees in Data Science and Economics from University of International Business and Economics. I'm driven by a passion for applying Generative AI across diverse fields to tackle real-world challenges.
  
  I have a keen interest in NLP and am enthusiastic about processing and analyzing textual information. I am also proficient in machine learning frameworks like PyTorch. 

  I am currently working with [Professor DK Lee](https://www.leedokyun.com/bitlab.html), focusing on research in Generative AI.
